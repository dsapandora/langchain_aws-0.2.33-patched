# langchain-aws Patched Wheel

This repository provides a **patched build of `langchain-aws==0.2.33`** with relaxed
NumPy constraints, so it works with **NumPy 2.x** (e.g., `numpy==2.2.6`).

The official release of `langchain-aws` restricts NumPy to `<2`, but since
`langchain-aws` is pure Python and does not rely on NumPy internals, the package
is fully compatible with NumPy 2.x.
